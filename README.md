## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned what is the importance of responsiveness of the web page. I also learned how to use media queries, though I still need to learn more about. And last, making your codes clean makes it easier to find the root of problem (If there's any).


### Continued development

I want to improve my alignment skill, it is still quite bothersome when I can't find the reason why my elements doesn't lign up. There are plenty of techniques that are posted in the internet and I should find the best fit for my liking.
